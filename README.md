## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** monetary policy communications and **India VIX** (volatility index) movements. It combines NLP-based sentiment analysis with market data to build a real-time volatility shock prediction system.

The core hypothesis: *Strongly-worded RBI communications — regardless of whether they are hawkish or dovish — precede larger-than-normal moves in the India VIX.*

### What This Project Does

1. **Mines & digitises** 140 RBI policy documents (Governor speeches + MPC minutes) from 2020–2026.
2. **Scores sentiment** on each document using [ProsusAI/FinBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) with a sliding-window chunking approach for long documents.
3. **Merges** sentiment scores with daily India VIX and Nifty 50 market data fetched via Yahoo Finance.
4. **Models** the probability of a VIX shock using a Random Forest classifier trained on 5 engineered features.
5. **Deploys** an interactive Streamlit dashboard (**RBI Sentinel**) that runs real-time inference on any pasted RBI communication.

## Key Findings

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Documents Analysed** | 140 (102 speeches + 38 MPC minutes) |
| **Date Range** | January 2020 – February 2026 |
| **Sentiment Score Range** | −0.4512 to +0.7419 |
| **Shock Threshold** | VIX return > 80th percentile of training period |
| **Model** | Random Forest (300 trees, max-depth 4, balanced class weights) |
| **Training / Test Split** | Chronological — train ≤ 2024, test ≥ 2025 |

### The Critical Insight — Intensity Over Direction

The initial OLS regression of raw sentiment score vs. VIX returns showed **no statistically significant linear relationship** (p > 0.05). Positive speeches didn't reliably lower VIX, and negative speeches didn't reliably raise it.

The breakthrough came from reframing the problem:

> **It's not whether the RBI sounds positive or negative — it's how _strongly_ they speak.**

Using the **absolute value of sentiment** (intensity) as the predictor and modelling VIX **shocks** (binary: did VIX move more than 1 SD?) via logistic regression yielded a statistically significant relationship. This insight carried forward into the final Random Forest model.

## Data Collection

### RBI Communications (140 PDFs)

All documents were manually downloaded from the [RBI website](https://www.rbi.org.in):

| Source | Count | Period | URL Section |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Governor Speeches** | 102 | 2020–2026 | RBI → Press Releases → Speeches |
| **MPC Minutes** | 38 | 2020–2026 | RBI → Monetary Policy → MPC Minutes |

Each PDF was named with a date prefix (e.g., `2024-02-08_minutes.pdf`) and stored in `data/raw/speeches/` and `data/raw/minutes/`. Text extraction was performed using `pdfplumber`.

### Market Data

| Ticker | Source | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `^INDIAVIX` | Yahoo Finance | India VIX (fear gauge) |
| `^NSEI` | Yahoo Finance | Nifty 50 index |
| `^VIX` | Yahoo Finance | CBOE VIX (US volatility, used in live dashboard) |

Market data was fetched from January 2020 onwards. RBI communication dates that fall on weekends or holidays are forward-merged to the next available trading day using `pd.merge_asof(direction='forward')`.

### Sentiment Scoring (FinBERT)

Standard BERT models truncate inputs at 512 tokens. RBI documents are often 3,000–10,000+ tokens long. This project uses a **sliding-window chunking** approach:

1. Tokenise the full document (no truncation).
2. Split into **510-token chunks** (reserving 2 tokens for `[CLS]` and `[SEP]`).
3. Run each chunk through FinBERT independently.
4. **Average** the softmax probability vectors across all chunks.
5. Compute `Score = P(positive) − P(negative)`, yielding a value in `[−1, +1]`.

### Feature Engineering

The final model uses **5 features**, computed on each RBI communication day:

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `Sentiment_Intensity` | `\|Sentiment_Score\|` — magnitude of policy tone (the key insight) |
| 2 | `VIX_Lag1` | Previous day's India VIX close (forward-filled for gaps) |
| 3 | `Nifty_5d_Ret` | `ln(Nifty_t / Nifty_{t−5})` — 5-day log return |
| 4 | `Nifty_5d_Std` | Rolling 5-day standard deviation of daily Nifty log returns |
| 5 | `Is_MPC` | Binary flag: 1 if MPC minutes, 0 if Governor speech |

### Target Variable

A **VIX Shock** is defined as a VIX return exceeding the **80th percentile** of training-period VIX returns. The threshold is computed **only on the training set** (≤ 2024) to prevent data leakage.

### Model Configuration

```python
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=300,
    max_depth=4,
    min_samples_leaf=3,
    class_weight='balanced',   # handles class imbalance
    random_state=42
)
```

Features are standardised via `StandardScaler` fit on training data. The chronological train/test split ensures no future information leaks into training.

## Model Evolution

The project went through three analytical stages — each one building on the failures of the last:

### Stage 1: Baseline OLS (❌ Failed)

**Hypothesis:** Negative RBI sentiment → VIX goes up; positive → VIX goes down.

```
OLS: Sentiment_Score → VIX_Returns
Result: Pearson r ≈ −0.03, p > 0.05 — NOT significant
```

The raw directional relationship between sentiment and VIX returns was essentially zero. A lagged analysis (T−1 sentiment → T VIX) was also insignificant.

**Lesson:** The market doesn't care whether the RBI sounds positive or negative in a simple linear way.

### Stage 2: Volatility Shocks — The Abs-Value Fix (✅ Breakthrough)

**Hypothesis:** It's the *intensity* (absolute value) of sentiment that matters, not the direction.

```
Logistic Regression: |Sentiment_Score| → Volatility_Shock (binary)
Result: p < 0.05 — SIGNIFICANT
```

Using the absolute value of sentiment as the predictor and defining a VIX shock as a move exceeding 1 standard deviation, the logistic regression found a statistically significant relationship. The **odds ratio** showed that for every 1-unit increase in speech intensity, the odds of a volatility shock increased meaningfully.

**Lesson:** Strong language — hawkish *or* dovish — signals conviction, and markets react to conviction with volatility.

### Stage 3: Random Forest Classifier (✅ Production Model)

Built on the Stage 2 insight, the final model combines sentiment intensity with live market context (VIX level, Nifty momentum, volatility regime) in a Random Forest classifier. This model powers the live **RBI Sentinel** dashboard.

---

## Backtesting

A simple **"Sentiment Shield"** strategy was tested:

- **Signal:** If `|Sentiment_Score| > 0.4` on an RBI day, exit the market for 2 trading days.
- **Otherwise:** Stay invested in Nifty 50 (buy & hold).

The strategy was evaluated against a passive buy-and-hold benchmark over the full 2020–2026 period (1,519 trading days) using total return, max drawdown, and Sharpe ratio.

---

## Live Dashboard

**RBI Sentinel** is a Bloomberg Terminal-inspired Streamlit dashboard that provides real-time volatility shock prediction.

### Features

- **Live market sidebar** with India VIX, Nifty 50 5-day return, and CBOE VIX pulled from Yahoo Finance.
- **FinBERT inference** using the same sliding-window pipeline as training.
- **Transparent methodology** section explaining every step of the prediction.
- **Risk gauge** with colour-coded probability bands (Low / Moderate / High).

### Data Note

The `data/` directory is excluded from Git (files are too large). To reproduce from scratch, you will need to:

1. Download the 140 RBI PDFs manually from the [RBI website](https://www.rbi.org.in) and place them in `data/raw/speeches/` and `data/raw/minutes/` with date-prefixed filenames (e.g., `2024-02-08_minutes.pdf`).
2. Run the pipeline from Step 1 above.

Alternatively, the trained model artifacts in `models/` are included in the repository and the Streamlit dashboard can be used directly.

## Limitations

- **Small sample size:** ~130 RBI event-days in training. Results should be interpreted with caution.
- **No causal claims:** The model captures statistical *association*, not causation. Other macro events on RBI days are not isolated.
- **English-language model:** FinBERT was pre-trained on English financial text; nuances of RBI's specific phrasing may not be fully captured.
- **Regime dependence:** Model performance may degrade if market structure shifts significantly from the 2020–2024 training period.
